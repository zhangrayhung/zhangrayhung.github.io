It is excellent when there is a cinema near your living area. Especially when the cinema is on the ground floor of your living building. Yesterday, the movie was scheduled to begin at 09:00, however, I just started having my breakfast at 08:50. I had breakfast, and meanwhile, I changed my clothes. I made it to my seat at 09:05, and fortunately, the movie hadn't started yet.

The first section of *Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle* debuted in Hong Kong on August 14. It attracted me after I knew about its debut in Japan. Although I have read the whole content of the manga version, the action and fighting scenes still made me feel excited. I can't wait for the rest of the two sections now.
