The weekend began on a hectic Friday night. It was almost 10 p.m. by the time I got home. After wolfing down dinner, I was still working until 1:30 p.m. There were consecutive two nights when we didn't go to bed until after 2:00 a.m. Yet we had to get up early on both Saturday and Sunday.

Saturday started with breakfast at a Dim-sum restaurant in Tai Po with my mother-in-law. The food was bland, but at those prices we couldn't complain. We chatted a lot, actually most of topics came from mother-in-law. The oppressive heat sent us to a bubble tea shop as soon as we got home. I blame that matcha, pistachio and fresh cream for the stomachache during the weekend. I even seem to have dropped a kilogram since the weekend. We ate out again that evening, and the paper-tripe-chicken soup was absolutely delicious.

Sunday began early because we had to get a delivery. Time flies-summer is already winding down. It feels as if I have only been swimming a handful of times, and now August is nearly over. I should have savored the weekend and the last of the season, but instead I wasted hours on mindless short videos reading manga. A frustrating, disappointing end to the weekend.
