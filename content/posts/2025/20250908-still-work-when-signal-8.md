I hadn’t faced such a awful morning in years. Even with Typhoon Signal No. 8 issued and rain pouring in sheets, I still had to commute. Because the minibus service had been suspended, I had to walk to the MTR station. The only comfort was that I wasn’t alone. Several other commuters were facing the same journey, umbrellas in hand, walking through water on the ground. By the time I reached the station, the lower half of my trousers was soaked; I could actually wring water out of the fabric. Fortunately, my shoes lived up to their waterproof claim—my socks were still dry.
