During the team meeting in this morning, leader told to us that we shall keep at least 8 working hours per day due to HR department's review of working hours. Because our team's average working time was the least in the whole development centre! Plus, one female colleague who works in QA department worked 12 hours per day on average in October!

For more compliance, the legal department asked me to apply the security assessment for our AI website which runs in Mainland China. Absurdly, network police required some words like communist party, gun and the name of political person that should be filtered. We have been ordered to rectify the issues four times and they said they would come to our office to do onsite checking at 3 p.m. today. However, they checked again at 14:00 and then found some new input box hadn't been filtered. So they canceled onsite checking today. I really wanted to speak some dirty words. Such stupid politics related to AI will obstruct the development of techniques. Why can't they separate politics from everything?
