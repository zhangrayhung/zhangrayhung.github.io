Finally, I submitted my OKR filling of the fourth quarter. I feel thousands of cells of my brain died to complete this OKR filling, especially the part of AI utilization. It took me nearly 2 hours to fill because I had a deep consideration after my leader told me to go on some ideas and applications of AI. Ultimately, a rubbishy idea popped up from my mind. It is about using AI to aggregate and analyse Nginx configuration. In fact, I haven't had any insights about how to achieve it. I have been appreciating my leader to strive for increment of salary for me. He is an excellent and very nice leader.

What a huge shock to me yesterday! Katrina is hired by Reasonable the third time. I haven't seen such magical event in my life!
