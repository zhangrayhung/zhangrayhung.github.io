I didn't perform well on my English conversation with Keith on last Thursday. Sometimes I introduced some points that I hadn't been involved at all. I should prepare more topics in advance next time. Luckily, I have some activities to be shared tonight. We made two kinds of dumplings on Saturday. One type consisted of pork, cabbage and black fungus. Another one replaced cabbage with celery cabbage. Both of them tasted excellently with the pork bone soup.

On Sunday, we walked around to the outskirts and it was the second time we were there. I didn't think it's nice experience because it was already 16:00 and sky had already darkened, meaning I was not able to utilize my camera. A nice trip always starts in the morning.

Planning itinerary isn't an easy job. We hadn't gone to sleep until 2:00 a.m. for two consecutive days in order to book a good hotel. Ultimately, we had finished 4 nights booking but 2 nights with high expense. I have learnt a lesson that we must make reservation in a big advance. Once we decide to go somewhere, we should start to book hotel and tickets of public transportations.

A massive fire engulfed high-rise residential buildings at Wang Fuk Court in the Tai Po district, resulting in at least 44 deaths and many people wounded. The blaze, which started on Wednesday afternoon, led to total 7 buildings engulfed and the fire lasted to Thursday morning. I have never seen such severe and horrible fire amid our daily life. From those building cluster, every hole has a fiery red color shining through it, like hell! The extreame dry weather, so be sure to prevent fires.
