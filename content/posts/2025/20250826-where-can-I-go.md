How stupid am I this afternoon! When I tried to scan a document, I forgot to sign the date. At the second time, I scanned wrong format which should be png or jpg but I did it as pdf. So I had to leave and back my seat three times.

I become more and more frustrated now since I find that I am even not eligible to get Japanese talent visa. I start to complain myself why I didn't graduate a better university which ranks in 300 around the world. I start to regret why I didn't get a master degree. Although we already have the working visa in Canada, we are afraid of taking our first step. The whole responsibilities are on me since I am not good enough at English to get a job. Where can I go someday?
