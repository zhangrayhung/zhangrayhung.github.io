As time advances, we have fallen in love with each other for total 7 years. I feel our first date just took place yesterday. We sat on the cement bench together at Central Pier, back leaning on back. I think at that moment we didn't concentrated on the sea, the ferries or any other walkers. My brain was blank, only enjoying the date from this cute girl.

I have been thinking that we haven't stayed with each other for enough 7 years. It should be 4 years since the Covid-2019 separating us for 3 years. I don't think remembering the exact annual date is such important. Different person has different expression way, and for me, I prefer writing it down. Although it is tough to maintain our relation well, I am appreciated that you always give me good suggestions and confidence. For the days to come, I will follow your advices for most of the time. I haven't got rich because I don't adopt the quote that a man will get wealthy if he obeys wife's advices.
