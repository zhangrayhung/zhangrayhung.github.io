We don't know the reason why the cat changed his habit suddenly. He woke us up much earlier than before this week. After feeding him this morning, I fell asleep back soon and then made a dream.

In the dream, we tried to find a cheaper apartment that we were able to afford. The owner of house showed us his house which locates in countryside. It was a shared rent with his family, but the room which he would like to rent to us was big enough with all kind of furniture. What a shock to us! The house made by mud bricks and was extremely old. Plus, our room would leak water on rainy days. However, the surroundings were stunning and beautiful. In front of the house, we could see a cluster of houses built in mountain which just like we saw in Amalfi, Italy. On the other side, there was a mountain and it looked like Mount Fuji but decorated by pink. I tried to take a photo for all the amazing scenes in front of me. Weirdly, my phone could never focus on scenes in the dream.

Today, the same Redis cluster as last Friday triggered alarm about lack of memory. So I have to apply new servers and extend its max memory. It was a huge task because I have to spend lots of time to move slots of Redis Cluster. Fortunately, alarm triggered in the morning and I got enough time to handle this time. Even so, I still came home late to eat the pasta you cooked.
