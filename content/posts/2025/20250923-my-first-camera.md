Today is the Autumn Equinox, and it makes me remind the night before yesterday. I was listening the song *愛在深秋* performed by Alan Tam Wing Lun. *Let my love lean on the late autumn...*

On the weekend, we went to purchase my first camera. It was Fujifilm x100vi with classic and stunning appearance which hugely attracted me. I also appreciated its compact shape. In a word, I satisfied its appearance and features although the complex parameters confused me. The silvery version cost me 14500 HKD and I hadn't bought such expensive electronic device before. It's hard to express or describe what I saw and what I experienced by writing down diary. I hope this camera will be my best parner who shares the same feelings and scenes as me after my 30 years old life.

Today I came back home early at 12:30 because the government annouced there will be "Five stops", meaing stop classes, stop work, stop production, stop transportation and stop business. This is the first time I met this highest level of alert signal about natural disaster. The typhoon "桦加沙" is approaching soon and I hope our windows are strong enough to defence the typhoon. All is well.
