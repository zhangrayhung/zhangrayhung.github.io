At last Friday night, I started to fell unwell and then felt sick on Saturday. I thought I was infected by my colleagues becasue most of them sneezed without health measure, which spreading germs around the space. Why can't they realize the health problem and only one man would use tissue to cover when sneezing.

Eating out three times this weekend and the tickets of Cantonese Opera cost us total 1811 HKD. The expenses were so large these two years that our progress of saving money was very slow. This was the first time I watched Cantonese Opera in such great theater with graceful and comfortable environment. I would say this was the first time in a theater. Excellent atmosphere did provide different experience where smoking, noise, firecracker and lampblack didn't exist. I started to understand that in the past, nobles and celebrities enjoyed the pleasure of Operas. From my perspective, not always being traditional is a good thing, sometimes it needs innovation. Only by attracking more youger audiences to watch can traditional art be better inherited as some day elder people will leave the world. One of the artists played the funny character by cross-dressing and introducing modern humor. I think this is a great innovation and expression, just don't go too far.
