Yesterday, we went to Mong Kok and my wife bought her second camera with zoom lens. She sold her old olympic camera with 1,800HKD and the new Sony camera with lens cost her around 13,000HKD. This means her level of photography complete more professional transition.

When I was at middle school, one day my father phoned with me. At that time, I had just finished my dinner, and the sun was setting in the west, casting a warm glow. I told to my father that I enjoyed every scenes about nature and I would like to capture them. My father comprehened at once and asked me if I wanted to possess a camera. I answered yes but let us discuss after I graduate. Then he got me first cell phone when I was at high school. It was a Sony Ericsson with multiple media and photo-taking function. I used it to take lots of photos of nature.

However, I still haven't had my own first digital camera. So, I have a strong desire to own a camera before I turn 30.
