As the Human Resource department did before, they are going to launch the KPI's goal of Quarter 4 in following days. This quarter I really don't know how to fill my KPI's goal. The first month is going to end after tomorrow and I still can't find any innovative items that I have done or I will do in the next two months. Although sometimes I was busy, most of them belong to routine and repeated work.

For my own goal of 2025 year, I planned to finish eight English books but only two books done. I don't feel guilty because I implement other unexpected plans this year. The first one is that I have started English conversation in Amazing Talker. I don't think I make a big improvement, but at least I build confidence now. Another one is that I passed the AWS DevOps certificate exam. On July 25, I thought I had to take this kind of exam because AWS is essential in foreign enterprises. After I shared the information to you, you were inspired and then registered PMP exam as well. We spent so much time on revision in self-study room on the weekend that we could both pass our own exam. In fact, I didn't try my best because I should have spent triple time on the revision. The types of questions were fixed and most of them that I revised before. I should have been good at the exam if I could spend triple time to do the revision. Both questions and answers were such complicated, long context and tricky, which meaning 53 hours on revision were not far enough.

I have already walked out from joy of passing exam. I do acknowledge that I still lack experience in many techniques and I must start my next stage learning from now on.
