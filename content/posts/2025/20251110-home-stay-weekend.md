We stayed at home and study-room the whole weekend. Although narrative and documentary of interview are much more boring than a fiction, I finished reading the chapter 2 of *The Nolan Variations*. This chapter tells me about the structure of Nolan's movies. The experience of childhood and movies he saw had a great influence on his own movies in the future. His structure is always imaginative but not detached from reality.

I learnt how to cut video on Sunday. Maybe some day, I will have my own film. These two days I was thinking if I need to continue to learn Japanese. If I utilize this time in English, perhaps it will be more useful in my pratical life and job.
