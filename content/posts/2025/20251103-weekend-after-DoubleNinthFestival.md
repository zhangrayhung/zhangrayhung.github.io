Sometimes going back countryside and town could make me feel relax. In contrast, the rhythm of big cities always bring me anxiety and tiredness.I have been thinking what I need in my life. But now I know one of my pursuit is that birds' sound wakes me up every morning. The moonlight drifts in the window and falls on our bed at night. The birds' songs form into my alarm of clock in the morning. I do enjoy these moments exist in your hometown.

On Saturday, we enjoyed a wonderful lunch in a restaurant surrounding by trees. I learnt how to make Xinhui aged mandarin peel and experienced it the fist time. Ultimately, I had a trip in Kaiping Diaolou and Villages, the World Cultural Heritage. I did admire thoes people who born in these villages. They were able to go to oversea, such as Canada, USA, Malaysia and HongKong. After they got rich and then contributed their villages.

On Sunday, this is the second time I went to sweep your ancestors' graves. This time we went together with your younger sister. More people, more interesting. Talking together in a car could promote emotional and family harmony among each other.
