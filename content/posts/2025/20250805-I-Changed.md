We had a cold war and didn't speak to each other last Friday night. It was because I wasn't willing to eat out to save money. I even told my wife she could eat out if she wanted to, and that I would cook for myself at home. She was angry and didn't talk to me for several hours. At that time I swore to stay silent until she began to say the first word. Since I thought I did nothing wrong, and what my goal was to reduce living expenses.

Things finally warmed up between us after she came over and talked to me. She complained that I had changed and no longer conforted her. I have been thinking this for four days. Have I changed? Yes, I have. I have changed and become not to embrace her. I used to clasp her as long as she felt sad and frustrated. I did not win the cold war. How could I treat my good girl like this?

From last night to now, the Black Rainstorm hit most of territory of Guangdong Province and the rainfall reached 100mm/h (The news reported it was the first time after 2018 year). HongKong has better precaution so that today you could work from home.
