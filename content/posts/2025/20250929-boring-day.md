This year the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday overlap again. After tomorrow’s workday I’ll have eight consecutive days off. I used to look forward to long holidays, but now I’m fearing going home. As my parents ask us when we’re going to have a baby. I don’t have an answer myself.

Because the long holiday is approaching, the company has prohibited any changes to production, so I have very little to do. I’m bored all day and just wander around the office park.

I didn’t sleep well last night because the cat kept jumping on and off the bed before dawn, meowing for food. I’m starting to worry that he’ll annoy my mother-in-law while we’re back hometown. We should remind her to fill his bowl before going to bed.
