This year, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday overlap again. After tomorrow working day, I am going to have 8 consecutive days off. In the past, I was looking forward to long holiday, but now I fear going home. I am afraid to confront the situation that my parents ask us when will we have a baby. In fact, I don't have the answer by myself either. Because of approaching long holiday, our company prohibits to make changes in production. I get little things to do these days. I feel bored the whole day and just had a walk on around the building cluster.

I didn't sleep well last night since the cat jumped up and down our bed before dawn, calling for attention that he was starving. I start to concern that the cat will annoys your mother when we are in hometown. I think we should tell your mother to prepare enough food on his plate before going to bed.
