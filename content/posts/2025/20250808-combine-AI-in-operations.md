Applications and products of AI are blasting rapidly every day, causing anxiety not only for the CEO of my company but also for me. I deeply thought serveral days about how to apply AI to my routine work. However, an efficient way in practical scenarios hasn't been arisen on the top of my head. So far the most commonly used scenario for AI is assisting me in writing Python codes and SHELL scripts. Anyway, I am working on a project about detecting and fixing AOF files of Redis now.

I still felt disappointed to myself since I didn't perform well on my English lesson last night. I didn't understand some questions from Keith. I expressed sentences or vocabularies wrongly. Plus, I am still unable to hear lots of meaning from English TV series and short videos. When does the day come that I can hear total English content just like a native?
