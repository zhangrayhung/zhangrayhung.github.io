It has been a long time since we last went out on the weekend. We had been staying in Fanling because typhoon and rainstorms hit during the past several weekends. Today, we decided to go to Tai Po for a long walk around the area. For lunch, we ate rice noodle with fish balls and fish skin at a local restaurant "海達魚蛋" which suggested from Youtube video. After that, we spent quite a lot of time walking through the shops in a plaza, from zone A to zone D. Eventually, you purchased a pair of sport shoes from an exclusive Nike store, causing you 1049 HKD. however, two hours later, we were still waiting in line at a restaurant. I had never expericed having to wait from number 566 to number 759 before, so we gave up on eating sushi at Sushiro and decided to have Vietnamese food insted.
