Holidays are always gone fastly, and I come back the office today.

I am so glad that my mother contents the windproof and waterproof coat we buy for her. Luckily, we choose the M size instead of S size, otherwise it isn't suitable. It seems my father would also like a cloth as present. Maybe I should buy one for him before lunar new year. Although my parents and relatives didn't ask us when we will have a baby this time, I start to worry about it again because there are only four months before the lunar new year. Next time when we go back home, I will bring a tower and a mug for brushing teeth. That wasn't a good day on lunar 14th of August, strong typhoon and heavy rain caused traffic jam and cantonese opera canceled.

By the way, next time I make a decision that we should resume the tradition about admiring the full moon. Puting many mooncakes and various fruits on the table, and drinking tea together would certainly impress us.
