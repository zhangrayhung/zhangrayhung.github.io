I experienced a long dream last night, but now I have forgotten most of scences. In the first dream, I went back to high school and took a math exam. I got a bad result and other students around me got higher scores than me. I felt very disappointed. In another dream, we brought our cat Chewy to big city from my hometown. One day the cat was ill and became dirty and thin. So I took him to pet hospital but the vet couldn't save his life.

I thought he won't wake me up if I gave him enough food before going the bed. However, he was used to wake us up as long as he got up. So he won't go to check his food plate, and until I brought him to the food area then he could realize there were food!
