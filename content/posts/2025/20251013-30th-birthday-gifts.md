It feels like only a short while has passed since the last decade. What happened in 2015 still feels like yesterday. *I got up late and then pushed my bike across the bridge which connecting dormitory and classroom. The bridge was crowded with pedestrians. I was confused abount my future.* Ten years later, I am still puzzled about the future. I don't know which step shold I take next and there is more uncertainty.

I am turning 30 years old in two days, how horrible that is! Thankfully, I'm not alone on this journey because you give me infinite courage and confidence. Now it is not tough for me to take the next step. Thanks for your gifts - the book *The Nolan Variations: The Movies, Mysteries, and Marvels of Christopher Nolan* and the coffee grinder. I love them a lot.
