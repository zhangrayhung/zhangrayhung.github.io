I have been thinking are there any gifts that I bought for you have a deep impression on you. A pair of earrings in the shape of orange, a white denim jacket, a pair of Sony earphones, the white Asics sport shoes, or a pair of leisurely yellow leather shoes? It seems all of them doesn't leave lasting impression on you. So this time you got the 999.9 golden necklace for birthday gift from Chow Tai Fook, which costing me 9758 HKD. Just past two years and the price of gold has climbing more than twice, reaching 46940 HKD per 37.799g.

In the morning of Sunday, after breakfast we decided to watch the movie *Zootopia 2*. Suddenly I got alert message from my company's server before departure, so I had to handle it first and then I was 35 minutes late to the theater. In fact, I have deployed an AI tool to automatically fix this alert but only one Redis instance fixed. I just trubleshot it and found some bug in my programming. After finished movie, we started the busy preparation of making dumplings again.

Thanks for helping me wash the dishes after dinner. You did a great job although still some oil attached. I had to spend 30 minutes if I did the dishes and then we wouldn't have enough time to go to shopping in Fusion market. 2025 year is approaching to the end, and it seems we have spent lots of money this year. Saving money is such tough.
