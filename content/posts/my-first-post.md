We had a cold war and didn't speak to each other on last Friday night. It was because I wasn't willing to have dinner outside for saving money. I even asked my wife to eat outside if she would like to do that and then I cook by myself at home. She was angry and didn't talk to me for several hours. At that time I swore keeping silent until she began to say the first word. Since I thought I did nothing wrong, and what my destination is reducing cost of life.
