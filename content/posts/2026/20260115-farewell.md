Comparing last farewell in Reasonable three and a half years ago, I feel anxiety and more challenged today. I am getting older, economics is getting worst, and the occupation of mine has been requiring more and more techniques. I had been imagining that some day I could resign happily and then would take a long vacation at least more than 3 months. The fact is that my last day in this company is going to come true on tomorrow, but I feel nervous and hope to find a new job as soon as possible.

I gave some souvenir to my leader, the CTO and my teammates to thank for their suggestions on routine work. I leart a lot including calmness and leadership from my supervisor, carefulness and aggressiveness from my teammates.

Last night, I made a dream where I was taking the math exam but got unsatisfied scores. But it was my teacher who tought me history in second year of junior high school was correcting my math result.
