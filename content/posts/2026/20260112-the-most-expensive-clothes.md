Vanity drives me to become not economical any more, and I start to mind the brand of products after I watched lots of short videos about other people flaunting the brand of clothes. I start thinking how to make everything that I wear on my body more recognizable. Therefore, I spent 2723 HKD(after 30% off) to buy my most expensive clothes in mylife. Not making a good transition, I rather corssed a big step, improving my expenses from 500 to 2723! *Tommy Hilfiger*, I hope the coat bought from this shop could stop me from buying any coat at least 3 years.
