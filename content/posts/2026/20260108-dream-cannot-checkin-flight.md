I made a weird dream last night. We went to check in the flight to Fukuoka, Japan in HongKong International airport. You finished checking in but when it was my turn, the staff left the counter and went to have lunch. So I had to move in another line where many people waiting for. Gradually, other staffs left one by one and all staffs were having lunch eventually. All the counters became a place for food just like canteen in my university. I was huge anxious because the departure time is 14:30 and they started to work at 14:00. I didn't know what was going on and then I went out from airport and found some couples were holding wedding.
