It is 2026 year already and I just created a new directory to store my 2026 moods. AI is developing rapidly, I just used Gemini CLI to help me show Last modify Date in my each article's header, and generate a concise and elegant Tags page. What I need to do is just telling it the requirements, answering yes or not and typing which option. I indeed feel this is the moment that I saw in a science fiction movie *Alien*, communicating with a centre computer which they called it *Mother*. The *Mother* executed commands and controlled the space ship while humans just needed to ask and made a choice.

Last night we argued with each other again because I didn't want to show my teeth to you. I thought it's privacy and felt embarrassed. I wasn't intent to hurt you as different people's ways to express love are different. Even though we are a couple, it doesn't mean both of us could force each to do something unwilling. Anyway I love you and apologize for it. I will show you.
