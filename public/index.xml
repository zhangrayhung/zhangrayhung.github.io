      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a cold war and didn&amp;rsquo;t speak to each other on last Friday night. It was because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to have dinner outside for saving money. I even asked my wife to eat outside if she would like to do that and then I cook by myself at home. She was angry and didn&amp;rsquo;t talk to me for several hours. I swore keeping silent at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
